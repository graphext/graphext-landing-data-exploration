# Cursor Rules for graphext-landing-data-exploration

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER** make git commits without confirming with the user first
- Always show the changes and ask for explicit approval before running `git commit` and `git push` commands
- Wait for user confirmation before any git operations that modify the repository

## Project Context
- This is a Next.js landing page for Graphext
- Uses Bun as the package manager
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Uses Lenis for smooth scrolling
